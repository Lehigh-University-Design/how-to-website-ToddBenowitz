  <img src="image3.png" alt="cookie">  

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups chocolate chips<br /></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.<br /></li>
    <li>Cream the Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.<br /></li>
    <li>Add Eggs: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.<br /></li>
    <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.<br /></li>
    <li>Add Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.<br /></li>
    <li>Scoop the Dough: Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.<br /></li> 
    <li>Bake the Cookies: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.<br /></li>
    <li>Cool and Enjoy: Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely<br /></li>
    <li>Serve: Once the cookies are completely cool, they are ready to be enjoyed! Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.<br /></li>
  </ol>
